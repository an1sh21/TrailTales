## Problem Statement

Sri Lanka's economy depends heavily on tourism, contributing 14% of its foreign exchange earnings and 7.6% of its GDP (SLTDA, 2023). However, the sector relies mostly on traditional guided tours and individual sightseeing, which often fail to captivate modern tourists. Research reveals that:
- **82%** of visitors prefer technology-enhanced experiences (Alsop, 2022)
- **66%** are specifically interested in Augmented Reality (AR) for location-based exploration (Joshi, 2023)

There is a strong need for innovative, immersive tourism experiences that blend education, adventure, and technology.
